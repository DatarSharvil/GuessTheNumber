# About:
  A CLI game that selects a number between 1 and 100 and you have to choose it on Linux x64 (Debian based and non-Debian based) and Windows 8+ x64 and macOS (macOS 11+) without an internet. Enjoy!
# Requirements:
  <p> Minimum: Java 21 </p>
  <p> Recommended: Java 21 </p>

# Usage:
  1. Linux (Debian-based): Just install the .deb file the way you like and enter the command "guessthenumber" from any terminal to execute.
  2. Linux (Non-Debian-based): Extract the tar.gz file and run the script using a terminal.
  3. Windows: Double click the .exe to install the application and add it to your user PATH variable and run "guessthenumber" from any terminal to play!
  4. macOS: Same as Non-Debian based Linux.
